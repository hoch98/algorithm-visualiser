# Algorithm Visualizer

Allows you to try out different graph traversal algorithms (dfs, bfs, etc)

Somehow 90% of the project so far has been trying to figure out how to make a curved arrow between 2 nodes.

Currently, only depth first search has been implemented.



## Features

- Adding edges
- Resetting nodes
- Depth first search
- Selecting/moving nodes


## To-Do

- Implement more algorithms

- Implement changing number of nodes

- Dark mode would be cool

- Usage of edge selection system
